#1. Naive
	$ Weakness: Bad for repetative letters
#2. Accelerated Naive
	-
#3. Boyer-Moore
	* Strength: English words
	$ Weakness: Long patterns with repetative letters (DNA for example)
#4. Rabin-Karp
	* Strength: Hashing, rolling hash is fase
	$ Weakness: misses (bad hash function)
#5. KMP
	* Strength: V.fast
	$ Weakness: pre processing time is a lot. Hence won't be that good for looooong texts without much repetative characters
#6. FSM
	* Strength: O(n)
	$ Weakness: Complicated and long preprocessing time
#7. Suffix Trie
	* Strength: O(m)
	$ Weakness: not in-place
#8. Suffix Tree
	* Strength: O(m)
	$ Weakness: not in-place
