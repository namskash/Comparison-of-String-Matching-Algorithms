# A Rigorous Comparison of String Matching Algorithms
This is a project that practically tests does **time complexity** analysis and comparisons of different string matching algorithms on a large set of test cases.

## Algorithms 
1. Naive
2. Boyer-Moore
3. Rabin-Karp
4. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)

### _I also did a study of the following algorithms:_
1. Accelrated Naive
2. Finite State Machine
3. Suffix Trie
4. Suffix Tree
