# A Fairly Rigorous Comparison of Four String Matching Algorithms
This is a project that practically tests the **time complexity** analysis of different string matching algorithms on large sets of test cases.

## Algorithms 
1. Naive
2. Boyer-Moore
3. Rabin-Karp
4. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)

> I also did a study of the following algorithms:
> 1. Accelrated Naive
> 2. Finite State Machine
> 3. Suffix Trie
> 4. Suffix Tree
